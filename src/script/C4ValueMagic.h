// Okay, here is the problem. For C4ValueArray, there is a refcounting scheme, and that can be easily abused to not do refcounting during script execution and only accumulate the refs afterwards. For C4PropList (and children) there is something more tricky: A proplist actually knows all places from where it is being pointed to, and it can zero those places at any time (esp. if it is being deleted).
// Now, I don't want to have the llvm code make calls to keep track of all the places a pointer to a proplist is stored. (ultimately, something like that might be the way to go, but for now, that seems rather complicated.)
// For now, I've got a (slightly inefficient) but better idea: I'll use an intermediate. Put refcounting on it, and shwoops, I can use the same trick as for a list.
